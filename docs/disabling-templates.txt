# Disabling Starter Templates

If you prefer generating projects entirely from scratch without importing any starter templates, set the environment variable `DISABLE_STARTER_TEMPLATES` to `true` in your `.env` file. When enabled, the app skips template selection and initializes an empty project based solely on your instructions.
